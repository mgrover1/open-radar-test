# Radx

## Quick description

The Radx C++ package was developed at NCAR to provide support for the new CfRadial radar data format, and to provide translation between common radar data formats. Radx is designed to be run on LINUX and MacOSX platforms, but should also run on Windows under Cygwin. It comprises a C++ library, which may be used by developers, and a number of applications built on that library.
