# Multiple-Doppler Radar Analysis Toolkit (MultiDop)

## Quick description
MultiDop is a Python-based interface between the C-based DDA code developed at University of Oklahoma and the Python Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) software developed at Argonne National Lab. Use this software to perform 3D wind analyses using 2-3 independent Doppler radars.
