# Open source - a necessary, not a sufficient criterion

We are aware that open source software is only one component of open science: consider it a necessary, not a sufficient condition to make research transparent and reproducible. It should come along with efforts to also make radar data open.

That is why we will also try to collect information about open access to weather radar data products. Can you help us? Have a look at our [open data page](../../pages/opendata.md), and report open data repositories!
