# Open source - a necessary, not a sufficient criterion

We will feature another 1-day open source software course on July 1st, 2018, at the [10th European Conference on Radar in Meteorology and Hydrology](https://www.erad2018.nl/). If you have not registered, yet... maybe a late-bird registration is still possible! See [here](http://openradarscience.org/erad2018/) for further details.
